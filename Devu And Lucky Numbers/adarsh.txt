You are given three integers  x, y  and z . You have to find the sum of all numbers whose digits are made of only  4,  5 and 6 , that have at most  x fours in decimal representation, at most  y fives in decimal representation and at most z sixes in decimal representation. As summation can be very large, print it modulo 10**9 + 7   .
